# LaTeX Resume Generator 📄✨

Generate a beautiful LaTeX resume seamlessly with Python! 🚀

`Instead of applying to jobs, I procrastinated and made this tool. Plz collab/hire me 😇`

## How to Use 🚀

1. **Personalize Your Data:** Update the `data.json` file with your unique details 📝
2. **Run the Magic Script:** Execute the `main.py` script (like `python3 main.py`) 🐍
3. **Get the LaTeX Output:** The script will automatically save your details to `Resume.tex` 🎉
4. **Compile and Shine:** Use your favorite LaTeX compiler to transform the `Resume.tex` file into a professional-looking PDF (I just use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)) 📄
5. **Get Creative with ChatGPT:** If you're feeling stuck or want to enhance your resume's content, use ChatGPT on the `data.json` file to brainstorm and generate innovative ideas for your resume! 🤖✨

- The script is not very flexible, so it requires some manual guess and checking
- Want to add automatic latex to pdf conversion script
